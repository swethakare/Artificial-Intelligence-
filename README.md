Project 1 - Construction of a Covering array using simulated annealing 
(refer P1_CS580sp23.pdf for problem statement and refer P1_SKARE.pdf file for more clarity on the project)

Finding the route in a maze using Astar algorithm 
(refer H1_CS5830Sp23.pdf for problem statement and refer H1_AstarMaze_Skare.py for implementation)
(implement pyamaze mode then try to execute AstarMaze)

Project 2 - Created an enhanced connect 4 game GUI, by taking the traditional game that applied Min Max algorithm and Alpha beta pruning techniques, refer(pdf for the details about the algorithms and to check the experiments and enhancements made)

Project 3 - Created a decision tree classifer to identify the type of wines experiment that has been carried out to check the combination of parameters that has to be passed to the decision tree to improve the accuracy.
