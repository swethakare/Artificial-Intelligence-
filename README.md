Project 1 - Construction of a Covering array using simulated annealing 
(refer P1_CS580sp23.pdf for problem statement and refer P1_SKARE.pdf file for more clarity on the project)

Finding the route in a maze using Astar algorithm 
(refer H1_CS5830Sp23.pdf for problem statement and refer H1_AstarMaze_Skare.py for implementation)
(implement pyamaze mode then try to execute AstarMaze)
